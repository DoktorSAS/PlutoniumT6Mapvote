 × How to setup the mapvote step by step

 1) Compile the file mapvote.gsc with a GSC Compiler.
 2) Copy the Compiled file in your Directory %localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm\
 3) Copy the Content of the mapvote.cfg in your .cfg (Exemple: server.cfg, dedicated_zm.cfg, dedicated.cfg, etc ) file that manages the Server.
 4) Edit the Dvars to setup the Server, many Dvars are only for Aesthetic Parameters.
    set the Dvar mv_maps to decide the maps that will be shown in mapvote, Example:
        set mv_maps "zm_tomb zm_buried zm_town zm_busdepot zm_farm zm_transit zm_prison zm_highrises zm_nuked"
    set the dvar mv_enable to 1 if you want have it active on your server.
 5) Run the Server and have fun. Done!
